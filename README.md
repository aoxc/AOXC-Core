# 🏛️ AOXC-Core | The Sovereign Fleet

**AOXC-Core** is a modular smart contract architecture built on **X Layer**. This repository tracks the evolution of a "Sovereign Fleet"—a system of 7 coordinated autonomous modules.

### 🛠️ Strategic R&D
* **Fleet Architecture:** Testing the coordination between 7 specialized modules.
* **Autonomous Logic:** Exploring the synergy between self-repair mechanisms and **DAO** governance.
* **High-Integrity Testing:** Built for the speed and scalability of **X Layer**.

### 🔬 Operational Note
This is a live technical experiment on the **X Layer Testnet**. We are building and refining the protocol's modular autonomy through active development.
