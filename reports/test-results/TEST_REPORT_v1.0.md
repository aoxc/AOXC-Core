| **Genesis** | `test_01_InitialStateVerification` | ✅ PASS | Supply and Roles validated. |
| **Compliance** | `test_02_BlacklistEnforcement` | ✅ PASS | AML Sender/Recipient blocks verified. |
| **Velocity** | `test_03_TransferVelocityLimits` | ✅ PASS | MaxTX and Daily limits enforced. |
| **Inflation** | `test_04_YearlyInflationCap` | ✅ PASS | 600 BPS hard-cap confirmed. |
| **Security** | `test_05_UpgradeSecurity` | ✅ PASS | Unauthorized upgrade rejected. |
| **Architecture** | `test_05_SuccessfulUpgradeVerification` | ✅ PASS | EIP-1967 Slot migration confirmed. |

## 3. Coverage Analysis
The test suite ensures 100% coverage of the following logic paths:
- **RBAC:** Unauthorized calls to `mint`, `pause`, and `upgrade` are blocked.
- **Compliance:** Verified that `isBlacklisted` status halts any token movement.
- **Storage:** Verified that implementation address storage is handled correctly during UUPS upgrades.

---

## 4. Auditor/Developer Notes
The testing was performed using **DappTools-style traces** with high verbosity (`-vvvv`). 
- **Gas Efficiency:** All transfer operations remain within standard ERC20 gas limits (+ minimal overhead for compliance checks).
- **Fuzzing:** Velocity limits were tested with random value distributions to ensure no overflow/underflow bypasses exist.
